# Fair-C45
1.This repository is the implementation of Multiple Fairness Criteria in Decision Tree Learning.
2.Each folder, which has been named by the name of dataset, has codes and dataset.
3.In each folder, name of each algorithm has been added at the end of .py file. 
4. Note: Results can be different because of random attribute choose.
For example;
ADULT_RACE_LEXICOGRAPHIC.py: the code is Lexicographic algorithm, sensitive attribute is 'Race', and run on Adult dataset.
ADULT_RACE_C4.5: the code has base C4.5 algorithm, will run on Adult dataset. Sensistive attribute is 'Race'.
